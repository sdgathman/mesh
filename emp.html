<h2> The Threat </h2>

Our sun regularly fires plasma torpedoes (called Coronal Mass Ejections or CMEs
by boring scientists) in all directions.  Every 100 years or so, it
scores a direct hit on the earth.  Whatever part of the earth happens to
be facing the sun experiences what is called an Electro Magnetic Pulse, or EMP.
NASA estimates that there is a 12% chance of this happening every decade.
The chances of personally experiencing an EMP event are 
<a href="http://www.empcover.com/solar-storm-coronal-mass-ejection.html">
double the chances</a> of experiencing a home fire.  

A nuclear weapon exploded at high
altitude, while not killing anyone directly, creates a man-made EMP (known
as HEMP) that is even more destructive than the natural solar variety.  

<h3> History of EMPs </h3>

In 1859, an EMP event called the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859">
Carrington Event</a> wiped out much of the telegraph infrastructure of the
time, including the transatlantic cables laid just weeks before.
In 2012, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012">
storm of comparable strength barely missed</a>.
In 1989, a CME hit northern Canada, blacking out their electrical grid.
<p>
You may not have to wait for the sun.  
In 1962, a <a href="http://www.futurescience.com/emp/test184.html">Russian above ground nuclear test</a> caused EMP damage, not as widespread due to the
low altitude. At the same time, the 
<a href="http://www.futurescience.com/emp/fishbowl.html">US was conducting
tests in the South Pacific</a>, and Starfish Prime at 400km was effectively
an EMP attack on the Islands of Hawaii.
On April 16, 2013, North Korea launched unarmed missiles in a trajectory to an
optimal EMP strike on the US.  North Korea has nukes, and thus their Dear
Leader has demonstrated that they can take us out any time he wishes.  We can
hope that that is sufficient for Dear Leader's ego (especially considering
the certain retaliation).  But Iran has also demonstrated an EMP trajectory
from Iranian ships in international waters.  Iran does not yet have a nuke, but
unlike North Korea, their rulers have a religious commitment to destroy the US.

<h2> Part of the Solution (the fun part) </h2>

There are many ways to prepare for an EMP.  You could buy land in the boonies,
stock up on guns, ammo, emergency food, and farm or hunt as civilization
collapses around you.  Too bad for those city slickers.  However, that solution
is too lonely for my taste.  
<p>
Doctor Pry's statement estimates that 90% of the US will die in an EMP.
However, the primary cause of all that death is a breakdown in communications
and transportation.  Although there will be a massive change in standard
of living following an event, backup means of communication and transportation
can prevent the widespread death.  
<p>
Here are some areas that need backup for people in the cities to survive:
<ul>
<li> Transportation of goods.  If a sufficient fraction of the fleet of 
trucks that service cities survives, food will be prioritized by becoming
very expensive in the city.  Hopefully, government will not interfere
with this. (Food stamps are less harmful than price controls.)
<li> Personal transportation.  Subways are somewhat protected underground.
But it will be months, at a minimum, before utility power can be restored.
Make sure you have a bicycle in good working order.  Or hire a rickshaw.
<li> Banking transactions.  These also need communication.
<li> Communication - needed to order that now very expensive food
(and maybe some toilet paper) from suppliers with enough efficiency
to supply a (formerly) modern city.
<li> Victory Gardens.  In World War II, city dwellers planted tiny gardens 
on rooftops and window planters.  This helped reduce the need for food
imported from farmers outside the city. 
</ul>

It is important not to envy the people that will become very rich meeting
these needs.
<p>
My interest is in preparing a mesh based backup to the internet.  An EMP
event will not take out the entire world.  You
will not be able to watch movies on this backup internet - but grocery
stores would be able to order from suppliers.  Hopefully, other smart
people will be fascinated by the other challenges.  Like enabling trucks,
especially, to survive an EMP event.  (Cars may not be worth the investment -
they are essentially a luxury in the city.)
<p>
The main things needed to be able to bring up a backup internet are:

<ol>
<li> EMP Protection.  None of the equipment will be any use if it 
gets fried by the EMP.
<li> Power Generation. Bicycle generators (the bicycle doesn't need
protection, just the generator and regulator/charge controller), batteries,
diesel generators (can run off hemp oil if the government ever stops
banning hemp even though it isn't a drug), treadle desks to charge your
laptop with power drill while you work (the desk doesn't need protection,
just the power drill and regulator/charge controller).
<li> Mesh Networking.  Small, low power, Wifi routers running open source
software with mesh networking, directional antennas for longer distance
point to point links.
<li> Computing Equipment. Laptop computers and smart phones to use the internet
once we get it back up in some form.  Small switches for local LANs.  Bloated
web pages like facebook and amazon will be VERY slow to load.  People
will need to use chat applications instead of voice as much as possible.
<li> Drills.  Every 6 months to a year, we all break out backup 
equipment (not all of it - in case an event/attack happens during the drill),
and pretend there is no utility power or local ISP internet.  The drill
coordinator will designate a distant location as the closest internet
gateway.  How quickly can we create the local mesh to replace broadband 
providers, connect local meshes, and ultimately the gateway within
one of the local meshes.
</ol>

<h3> Mesh Networking </h3>

Amateur radio enthusiasts already participate in providing emergency
communication during disasters, including setting up wireless LANs and
internet.  This is great for hurricanes and floods, but they are
prohibited by law from carrying encrypted communication on their networks.
This does not meet the requirements of allowing business and banking
transactions.
<p>
My current plan is to use batman-adv to join the wifi equipment in a
neighborhood into the wireless equivalent of a cable provider.
Directional line of sight links will join local meshes with point to
point links.  Instead of emulating traditional BGP routing, inter-mesh links
will use manual routes (which would make failure of a point to point link 
problematic), or more often will connect nodes running the
<a href="Cjdns - Wikipedia.html">cjdns</a> protocol, which
creates an IP6 VPN that requires no central allocation of IP addresses
and routes automatically.

<h4>But how will I connect to my bank? </h4>

There is still a need to connect to "clearnet" (what cjdns enthusiasts
call the traditional internet) in the rest of the world that escaped
the direct EMP.  This is most easily done via IP6, as just the smallest 
possible IP6 space allocated to the gateway is huge compared to IP4,
and more than enough to spread to the entire affected area (even the
entire US).  However, some IP6 LAN protocols like SLAAC will not
work on the smaller subnets (less than 64 bits) that such an emergency scheme
would create.  Static address assignment and dhcpv6 will work fine, however.
The cjdns protocol directly supports tunneling IP6 and IP4 over 
the cjdns mesh.

<h4> But my bank doesn't support IP6! (The backward idiots) </h4>

Some enterprising business will be happy to run 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT64">NAT64</a> if you pay them
or ask them nicely.  Similarly, there are many VPN companies
who will be happy to tunnel IP4 access to you.

<h3> EMP Protection </h3>

My current idea is an ordinary steel file cabinet, with equipment inside
further protected by something like <a
href="http://www.empcover.com/emp-cover-bags-faraday.html"> these faraday
bags</a>.  The problem with using only a file cabinet, is that the cracks
around the drawers and smaller than wavelengths we have to worry about, but
they are long enough to form a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_antenna"> slot antenna</a>.

<h3> Power Generation </h3>

For working at a laptop without utility power, a 
<a href="http://www.eliotk.net/10/23/personal-desk-treadle-exerciserpower-generator-part-1/">treadle desk generator</a> is my personal favorite.
The drill and charge controller need to be protected.  (But not the treadle
or desk.)
<p>
For powering networking equipment, batteries charged by a 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/MNS-Power-Bicycle-Generator-Dynamo/dp/B003GJL6GO">bicycle generator</a> are more practical.  Both batteries and
generator need protection.  (But not the bicycle.) 
<p>
In many areas, solar battery chargers will be practical.  (My area is 
usually hazy or overcast, and crystalline solar panels are weak.)
<p>
For those with large enough shielded storage, a fuel powered generator
would be wonderful (until you run out of fuel).  With luck, you'll have
enough to stay up until the trucking companies are back in business
so you can buy more (much more expensive) fuel.
